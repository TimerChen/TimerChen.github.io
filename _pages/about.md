I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. [Yong Yu](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree from the [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests primarily lie in **machine learning**, with a focus on **deep reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems**. I am also deeply intrigued by the application of machine learning in the development of intelligent robotics, particularly in the area of **human-robot interaction**.
